//Conditional Comparison Statement with Temp

//Populated value in var determines whether the subsequent argument will execute.
var temp = 82;
if (temp>70) {goToTheBeach();
}

var temp = 82;//In this scenario, you are trying to compare values and look for an exact match
if (temp==70) {goToTheBeach();
}

//Nested Conditional

if (sunny){
    goToTheBeach();

    if (warmWater){
    wearNewSuit();
}

}else{
    {
        goToTheMovies();

//if the child is old enough, print to the console, "You can ride!"

//Relational Expressions-Check the relationship between 2 variables or values

var minHeight= 48;

//If over 48"

    if (kidHeight +2 > minHeight){//sneaker lift. Can also declare a variable value and add the two variables together

    var sneakerLift=2;

    if (kidHeight + sneakerLift > minHeight){//sneaker lift. Can also declare a variable value and add the two variables together

//If under 48"

//But what if neither condition is met? Use the less than or equal to operator
    if (kidHeight<=minHeight){
    }
//Alternative method that combines both with an else
