//Conditional Comparison Statement with Temp

//Populated value in var determines whether the subsequent argument will execute.
var temp = 82;
if (temp>70) {goToTheBeach();
}

var temp = 82;//In this scenario, you are trying to compare values and look for an exact match
if (temp==70) {goToTheBeach();
}

//Nested Conditional

if (sunny){
    goToTheBeach();

    if (warmWater){
    wearNewSuit();
}

}else{
    {
        goToTheMovies();
    }

var oldEnough=true;

//if the child is old enough, print to the console, "You can ride!"
if(oldEnough){
    //code to be performed if condition is true
    console.log("You can ride the coaster!");
}

//Relational Expressions-Check the relationship between 2 variables or values

var kidHeight = 30;
var minHeight= 48;
    
//If over 48"
if (kidHeight>minHeight){
}


console.log("You can ride the coaster!");
